People often talk about songs being in major key or in minor key. 

If we say a song is in C major, then it will mostly use nots token from scale of C major.

If we say it's in G major, it will mostly use notes token from the scale of G major.

> If a song is in major key, then you can move it around to any other major key.

The notes that the tune ends on is always a big clue on its key, because it's almost the note that the key takes its name from.
